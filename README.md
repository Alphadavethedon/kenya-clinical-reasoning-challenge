Clinical Reasoning with T5 Transformer
Zindi Competition: Kenya Clinical Reasoning ChallengeNotebook Link: Open in ColabCertificate: View Certificate

üìå Overview
This project implements a fine-tuned T5 Transformer model for clinical text classification as part of the Kenya Clinical Reasoning Challenge on Zindi. The solution uses Hugging Face‚Äôs transformers library to predict clinical outcomes from medical text data, optimized for efficiency on Colab‚Äôs free-tier GPU.
The goal is to provide an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission generation, tailored to the competition‚Äôs requirements.

üöÄ Key Features

State-of-the-Art Model:  

Fine-tuned T5-small for efficient training on medical text.  
Optimized with FP16 and gradient accumulation for Colab‚Äôs free-tier GPU.


End-to-End Pipeline:  

Covers data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and submission.  
Includes validation of submission format for Zindi compatibility.


Competition-Ready:  

Logs key metrics (accuracy, F1-score).  
Generates predictions in the required CSV format (ID, prediction).




üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup
Dependencies
Install the required libraries in your Colab environment:
pip install transformers datasets evaluate accelerate pandas numpy

Environment

Platform: Google Colab (free-tier GPU recommended).  
Python Version: 3.8+.  
Hardware: GPU acceleration (T4 or better).

Model Architecture
The model is based on T5‚Äôs text-to-text framework, adapted for classification.
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, TrainingArguments

model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-small")
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    fp16=True,  # GPU acceleration
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=3e-5,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True
)


üìä Data Preprocessing

Input Format: Clinical text (e.g., "Patient with fever and cough").  
Preprocessing Steps:  
Prefix text with "clinical text: " for T5 compatibility.  
Tokenize using T5‚Äôs tokenizer with truncation and padding.



from transformers import T5Tokenizer

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
inputs = tokenizer("clinical text: " + text, truncation=True, padding="max_length", max_length=512)


Data Source: Zindi-provided training and test datasets (assumed to be CSV files with clinical text and labels).

Training Process

Optimizer: AdamW (default in transformers).  
Metrics Tracked: Accuracy, F1-score (weighted).  
Cross-Validation: Uses StratifiedKFold for robust evaluation.

from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)
trainer.train()


üì§ Submission
Predictions are generated and saved to submission.csv in the following format:
ID,prediction
ID_CUAOY,0.0088
ID_OGSAY,0.0048
...

Validation
The submission file is validated to ensure compliance with Zindi‚Äôs format:
def validate_submission(df):
    assert {"ID", "prediction"}.issubset(df.columns), "Missing required columns!"
    assert len(df) == EXPECTED_ROW_COUNT, "Incorrect number of rows!"

To submit:

Download submission.csv from Colab.  
Upload to the Kenya Clinical Reasoning Challenge submission page.


üìà Performance
Note: Update with your actual results from the Zindi leaderboard.  

Validation Accuracy: 0.82 (placeholder).  
Validation F1-Score: 0.80 (weighted, placeholder).  
Zindi Leaderboard Score: > 0.85 (placeholder, replace with your score).

Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy and F1-score are computed during training.  
Cross-Validation: 5-fold StratifiedKFold to ensure robust performance.


üôã FAQ
Q: How do I run this notebook?A: Open the Colab notebook, ensure a GPU runtime, and run all cells.
Q: Why use T5 for clinical text?A: T5‚Äôs text-to-text framework is versatile, allowing it to handle medical classification tasks effectively when prefixed appropriately (e.g., "clinical text: ...").
Q: How can I improve performance?A: Experiment with:  

Larger T5 variants (e.g., t5-base).  
Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, epochs).  
Advanced preprocessing (e.g., medical term normalization).  
Ensemble methods.
